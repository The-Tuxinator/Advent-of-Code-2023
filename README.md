# Advent-of-code-2023
Back for one more year

## Day 1
Back to my regular frenemy, regular expressions.
For the first part, I bodged together a couple expressions and string manipulations that would nab the first and last digits, easy enough.\

Part two, nearly got it with a swtich to creating an array of every digit, except for the pesky overlapping "oneight". That is starting a new journey for me, learning about python regex lookaheads, got it to work for tonight but hoping to understand it better in the future.

## Day 2
