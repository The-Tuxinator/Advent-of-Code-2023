# Advent-of-code-2023
Back for one more year

## Day 1
Back to my regular frenemy, regular expressions.

For the first part, I bodged together a couple expressions and string manipulations that would nab the first and last digits, easy enough.

Part two, nearly got it with a switch to creating an array of every digit, except for the pesky overlapping "oneight". That is starting a new journey for me, learning about python regex lookaheads, got it to work for tonight but hoping to understand it better in the future.

## Day 2
Hey look! That thing I just learned is already back!

Part one was delayed a bit because I kept tripping up on assumptions, always read the prompt carefully. And maybe don't code after midnight.

Part two went much more smoothly, part 1 gave a solid base for the small changes I needed.

## Day 3
For the first task, typing was my enemy for some time, dealing with empty list items and the like, but I feel like I managed a fairly elegant solution to that all things considered.
