# Advent-of-code-2023
Back for one more year

## Day 1
Back to my regular frenemy, regular expressions.

For the first part, I bodged together a couple expressions and string manipulations that would nab the first and last digits, easy enough.

Part two, nearly got it with a switch to creating an array of every digit, except for the pesky overlapping "oneight". That is starting a new journey for me, learning about python regex lookaheads, got it to work for tonight but hoping to understand it better in the future.

## Day 2
Hey look! That thing I just learned is already back!

Part one was delayed a bit because I kept tripping up on assumptions, always read the prompt carefully. And maybe don't code after midnight.

Part two went much more smoothly, part 1 gave a solid base for the small changes I needed.

## Day 3
Python Regex, you are going nowhere it seems

For the first task, typing was my enemy for some time, dealing with empty list items and the like, but I feel like I managed a fairly elegant solution to that all things considered. Needed to read the documentation closer though, as I had an off by one from the match.end() index.

The second task was another pretty smooth transition with the code being flexible enough to pivot quickly.

## Day 4
Could have regex'd again, but I decide to spice it up with some .splits()

The first task went surprisingly quickly, very straight forward with the use of exponents.

I know there is a more clever solution for task 2, but I decided to prioritize coding time over execution time and go with recursion. This was a mistake, but when it finally terminated it was correct.

If I revise any, it will probably be this one.
